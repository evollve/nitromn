            <h2>The Science Behind Nitro Cold Brew</h2>
            <p>Nitro coffee is made by infusing cold brew with nitrogen gas. This infusion process creates microbubbles, giving the coffee a foamy, silky mouthfeel. Unlike carbon dioxide, nitrogen doesn't dissolve easily in liquids, resulting in smaller bubbles and a smoother texture. This science is what sets Nitro Cold Brew apart, offering a unique sensory experience.</p>

            <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>
            <p>The process starts with brewing coffee using cold water over an extended period, typically 12 to 24 hours, to extract a full, rich flavor. The cold brew is then infused with nitrogen gas through a pressurized valve with tiny holes. As the coffee exits through the tap, it creates a creamy head similar to that of a draft beer. The final product is a more aromatic and less acidic coffee.</p>
